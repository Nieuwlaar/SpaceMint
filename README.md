# Spacemint

This is a prototype of SpaceMint, which is described in
more detail at:
https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/528.pdf (Cryptocurrency)
https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/796.pdf (Proof-of-space; PoS).

Code used from: https://github.com/kwonalbert/spacemint.git
Also interesting: https://github.com/kwonalbert/pospace.*

This repo is used to locally run the Proof-of-Space from SpaceMint, as the aforementioned repositories were rather time consuming to implement. After downloading the necessary Go package:
"golang.org/x/crypto/"
and running the test file, the PoS results will show (begin with size = 1).
